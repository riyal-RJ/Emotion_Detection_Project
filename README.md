Project Title: Emotion Detection using CNN and FER-2013 Dataset from Kaggle
Summary: I spearheaded the development of a deep learning model to detect emotions in real-time from video streams. This project leveraged the concepts of CNN and Pre-Trained Models using Google Collab.
Technical Skills: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, ResNet50v2, VGG16, OpenCV
Contributions:
Enhanced model robustness by mitigating class imbalance within the FER-2013 dataset through image augmentation and class weighting techniques.
Designed, implemented, and iteratively improved custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to achieve optimal emotion classification performance.
Achieved a classification accuracy of 66% across seven emotion labels, as measured by precision, recall
Constructed a real-time emotion detection system by deploying the model to process live video streams using OpenCV.This system dynamically overlays emotion labels onto the video stream.
